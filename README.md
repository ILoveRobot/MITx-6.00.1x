# MIT6.00.1xSolutions
Solutions for problem sets, quiz and final exam of the course
MITx:6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using
Python.

It is highly recommended to solve the problem sets, quiz and final
exam by your own, and only use these solutions as a guide in case of
having trouble.

**Update:**

In January 2017, the contents of this course were updated to support
Python 3. I am very glad they improved this course since the future of
Python is Python 3 (at least for now). Though I originally provided
solutions for the original version of this course, I will continue
updating the contents of this repo in order to fit the new version.

## Running a program

In order to run a module you can simply:

```
$ python3 module_name.py
```

This way you can test that the solution provided is working properly.
Make sure to be inside the directory where the module is.
